Women in the Solution (WITS Email),Ongoing,,,"WITS is a closed online women's group of Alcoholics Anonymous. Our email meeting has two topics a week. In keeping with AA's singleness of purpose, we confine our discussions to recovery from alcoholism. One topic is taken from material written and approved as AA literature; the second topic is a ""General Topic Discussion."" All AA-related off topic shares are also welcome. The topics run concurrently, 24/7. Our group adheres to the 12 Steps and the 12 Traditions of Alcoholics Anonymous. For all other discussion not directly related to AA, we maintain a separate list (WITS-Coffee Talk) for posting of topics of a more general nature, i.e., other 12-step programs, meditations, general announcements, etc. We also have real-time chat meetings to address issues related to recovery from alcoholism. To join, please email: womeninthesolution+owners@googlegroups.com","Email,Chat,Women,Closed,24/7",womeninthesolution+owners@googlegroups.com,
